This project is useful for the learn comunication within arduino and system SCADA
control the level of toxicity in crops to avoid the death of pollinators, the toxic substances used by farmers are lethal to these animals since they eliminate benign bacteria from the immune system, which weakens defenses against diseases and causes faster death to pollinating animals.

##  Arduino is necessary
